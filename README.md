# Homepage of Bence Szab√≥

## Welcome

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at Bocconi University in Milan, starting my research in demographic economics, public economics, and empirical labor economics.

This webpage contains information about how my research is developing, and whatever else I find interesting to add going forward.
